# 🌱 Phase 5 — Content Cohesion (v0.5.0)

**Project:** Builder Hub / BrandBuilder  
**Status:** v0.4.5.4 complete — site stable, DNS verified, UI/hero polish finalized, and internal documentation synced.  
**Focus:** Begin Phase 5 with *Content Cohesion & Brand Alignment.*

---

## 🎯 Primary Goal
Align the **Builder Profile** and **Résumé** under the new **Brand** section — refining tone, structure, and cross-linking while preserving distinct purposes:  
- **Builder Profile →** narrative, philosophy, and identity.  
- **Résumé →** professional timeline and achievements.

**Preferred approach:** *Option A — keep separate pages but align language, structure, and shared references.*

---

## 🧩 Supporting Goals
1. Create consistent tone and formatting across both documents.  
2. Introduce cross-links (e.g., “See Résumé for project details” / “See Profile for values and approach”).  
3. Audit typography, spacing, and section hierarchy for visual harmony.  
4. Add shared metadata (SEO, social previews) for brand consistency.  
5. Defer full unification (“Professional Profile” wrapper) to future Phase 5.x if needed.
