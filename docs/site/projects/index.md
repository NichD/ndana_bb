# Projects

This section is under development.

Here you’ll find detailed writeups of Nicholas Dana’s active and completed projects — illustrating how systems thinking, data science, and design merge to create actionable intelligence. 

Each entry will explore:
- **Problem Context**
- **Analytical or Design Approach**
- **System Implementation**
- **Outcome / Insights**

Upcoming case studies will explore applied data science, system architecture, and design strategy projects — each documented with clarity, intent, and measurable outcomes.
