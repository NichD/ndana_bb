## Introduction

No Builder updates this week, I'm on the road at SITC. SITC is an immuno-oncology conference with a mix of clinicians, academics and professionals/vendors. My company, Elephas, has a booth and a poster presentation, and I'm the primary author of the latter. I arrived with excitement, alloyed with apprehension, but I've now found my stride and am ready for tomorrow.

## Main Content

It's been over 9 years since I was presenting at a medical conference, and only the 3rd time in my life.

The first time, 2014 at Heart Rhythm in Denver (thank you!) was certainly a stretch for me at that time. Nonetheless, I think I did well. Still, I approached this opportunity with apprehension. That apprehension is an echo of residual imposter syndrome. While I feel the grip of that legacy weaken, it still persists. I have always felt a tension between my current position and status, and my blue-collar origins, but that's a topic for another post.

This is a great opportunity for me, no doubt. As I review our poster for the umpteenth time the night before, I'm struck by the reflection that _my fingerprints are all over this thing_. Aside from the fact that the content is very exciting, I've been in the critical path of every aspect of these results. I acknowledge that I don't always make space for self-directed accolades, but at this moment I truly feel I deserve it. I can say that I'm ready for tomorrow, and that confidence is bolstered by being part of a terrific team that I know has my back.

My poster session starts mid-day tomorrow. Salvador Dali said "Don't worry about perfection, you'll never achieve it." While I know I'm not **the** expert on all aspects of this work, I know there's room for imperfection in this endeavor and that, somehow, bolsters my confidence. I wrap up my night sipping a glass of wine and jotting a few notes, looking forward to tomorrow.

## Takeaways

Making space for imperfection or failure isn't surrender to our limitations, it's an embrace of our process of growth, and a celebration of the many steps we take along that journey.
