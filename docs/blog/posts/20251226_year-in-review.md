## Introduction

I had to do a thing, then another thing, and then 2025 was over! So what happened this year? 2025 in review...

## Main Content

Before I knew it, December was over (I'm sure y'all can relate). Of course, I had plans, but we all know what happens to those. So what were the plans for this year? Where have I been, what was I trying to do and what did I achieve? Below are some of the goals for 2025 that I set out with and how they evolved as the year waxed on.

**Options Trading**

I spent last holiday season with a chosen family member that's retired, but whom actively trades stock options as their retirement job. They take it quite seriously, spending dozens of hours each week trading, researching, etc. They've been doing it for some years now, and I was lucky to spend time with them, absorbing their knowledge. This prompted me to start 2025 with a personal goal to net $20,000 in option trade gains by the close of 2025.

Well, I jumped into this task with all the gusto of someone with abundant over-confidence. In truth, I was making net gains for the effort. However, the gains were slim and the time commitment was considerable. Toward the end of Q2 I took inventory of the effort and outcome. That reality check confirmed I wasn't out-performing quality index funds and it was hard to justify the time spent, especially since I wasn't anywhere near on track for my 2025 goal. That prompted a step back and re-evaluation of my approach.

I have since done more research and collaboration and have a better approach that I'll start exploring in 2026. That said, it's clear this goal was a bust in terms of the dollar-metric, but a big win in terms of learning. The insight I gained in terms of how I approach financial efforts and the challenges that come with making regular, disciplined decisions in an emotional domain (like money).

**AI Learning and Development**

Another big personal goal of mine was to really lean in to AI, as a user and a developer. This involved a lot of exploration and learning, as well as identifying some reasonably-sized projects that I could sink my teeth into. It doesn't help the AI landscape experiences seismic shifts every few months, but that's what creates the opportunities, no?

I started 2025 with a playful approach toward AI. I tried out several different main stream models, with a variety of different use cases, from simple question answering to lengthy co-development projects. This morphed into regular usage of AI tools in my day job and ongoing exploration and testing in my free time for various side projects. I defitely got much more skilled and knowledgeable in terms of AI usage, and the general AI landscape.

As the year wraps up, I can look back and feel quite good about where things landed. I've put into 'production' several AI workflows and augmented 'products' (this site is one). The effort has also helped me make space for imperfection and uncertainty. I'm quite pleased with the overall outcome, and am looking forward to continuing this streak in 2026!

**Biotechnology (day job)**

My day job, as a Principal Data Scientist for a biotechnology start up (scale up?) was also a big focus of effort this year. I don't talk about it much here, mainly as this is a venue for my side efforts, but this is where most of my professional effort has gone this year, and I did have some accomplishments I was working toward.

2025 was a very dynamic year for my company. We entered it with some idea of where our platform was going, but it's ended with tremendous development, positive results and a much clearer path toward commercialization and profitability. I'm happy to say that I've been a chief architect of some major components of our initial commercial offering. I played a pivotal role in the development and implementation of every analytical aspect of our initial product. Of course, I'm part of a large team and so much of what we've accomplished is the amalgam of huge collective effort, but it's great to be a leader on this effort.

There's still considerable uncertainty about the future of my company (and the economy, world, ...). However, I feel more confident than I ever have about those future prospects, and I'm well situated in terms of my growth prospects in the company. I even received 3 award nominations from colleagues this last quarter.

**Travel and Adventure**

This section is going to be brief, because it was already a given. 2025 saw several firsts for me, including several new international destinations (finally visited Spain!), multiple international trips and a few new domestic destinations as well. I was able to spend some great time with family and friends, and continue to get more skilled at adaptability during travel.

Below are all the destinations for 2025:
Madison WI, USA (multiple); Salt Lake City UT, USA (multiple); Amsterdam, Netherlands; Prague, C.R.; Cancun, Mexico; Anacortes and San Juan Islands WA, USA; San Francisco CA, USA; Lake Tahoe CA, USA; Rekyjavik, Iceland; Barcelona, Ibiza and Madrid, Spain; Washington DC, USA; Miami FL, USA;

I think, all told, I traveld for ~25% of 2025, which is a new record for me. Here's to a baller 2026!

## Takeaways

Looking back at 2025, it certainly had a lot going on, and more than a few bumps in the road. It's crazy to reflect on all the accomplishments and challenges. I find this reflection helpful, both to bring all the individual things into focus, as well as to step back and see the big picture. Reflecting on this really helps be appreciate how dynamic and reslient I am, and reminds me to challenge my assumed limitations. On to 2026!
