## Introduction

I arrived home yesterday evening after several days at 'headquarters'. Today is all about productive non-work time.

## Main Content

At my day job, we have a big meeting at the end of the year. It's always a lot of energy and bustle, as we discuss next year's goals and wrap up accomplishments for the current year. It can be a bit taxing to be 'on' for several days, but I do always leave feeling a renewed sense of engagement.

It was also very encouraging to hear so much praise and positive regard from colleagues. I was reflecting on this both before and after the trip, partially due to my reading recently. I'm working my way through "Daring Greatly" by Brene Brown, and am currently working on the Shame chapter. Hearing how my work is viewed externally, as well as reflecting on my own internal critic, was very timely for seeing some patterns crop up. I certainly have some work still regarding self-acceptance, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to contrast how results are embraced differently by myself. I need to foster that acceptance and bring it in.

And on that note, taking today to be 'non-work productive' is a nice way to embrace feeling like I'm enough while still tackling some to-do items.

## Takeaways

Be graceful and accepting, as much for accomplishments as our quirks and flaws. Abandon perfection, you'll never achieve it (that last one was Dali).
