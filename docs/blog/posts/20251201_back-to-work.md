## Introduction

After enjoying some down time and respite after the US Thanksgiving holiday, it's time to get back to work and close the year strong.

## Main Content

Monday morning, just coming off the Thanksgiving holiday in the US. I had a great time catching up with my son, family and friends. I didn't even mind how hectic those holidays are (though the bickering children do drag a bit on my patiences, ha!).

Now with only a few weeks in the year, It's time to close out some projects. I've been pleased overall with the N8N workflow I have built. However, we're now at the point where the gap between 80% to 100% functional feels large and requires some digging in. Some aspects (e.g. web retrieval) don't seem to be working correctly, and some of the content parsing seems to be a miss.

I did see that there was a nice feature in N8N to help with this - Evaluations. Evaluations allow you to wire up a static data set (e.g. Google sheet) and pipe that input into specific nodes in your workflow, and retrieve the output and pipe it back to your sheet. Very handy way to evaluate more consistently the performance of individual steps and to compare how updates to a node (e.g. LLM-prompt) impact performance. I expect I'll be getting more familiar with this capability.

## Takeaways

Respite was lovely, but let's close the year strong and build some cool stuff!
