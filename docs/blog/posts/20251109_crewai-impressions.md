## Introduction

Wrapping up SITC 2025, I had the opportunity to explore CrewAI for a new project I'm tinkering with.

## Main Content

I had some time today before my flight, and I recently gotten a recommendation from a colleague to check out CrewAI. I have a pretty basic project, and from what my colleague indicated, this tool will be a great option for me.

My colleague had shared some suggestions on how to set up a flow, and so I have a pretty good idea where to go with it. I haven't gotten very deep into it so far, but my initial impressions are quite positive.

Once my account was created, their tutorial gave me a very light introduction to the platform. This is always a critical first test, as the quality and depth of software tutorials can be highly variable. That said, I felt CrewAI nailed it. The tutorial pointed out a few key panels and functions, and most importantly it introduced me to to the AI helper panel (left-side).

With a quick prompt, this tool outlined a basic workflow that set me up to get started quite well. The workflow was simple, but it included several agentic functions and primed them with some relevant tools and settings that helped me orient. I'm still updating the initial output from their assistant AI, but it was quite easy to get started. I'm looking forward to kicking the tires on this and seeing how it performs.

## Takeaways

CrewAI had an easy setup and helpful tutorial that, within minutes, got me setup to start developing an agentic workflow for a new project.
