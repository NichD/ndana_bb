### Phase 4 — Content Activation (v0.4.2)
**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress — Partial Completion  
**Focus Area:** Blog system integration and taxonomy rendering (MkDocs Material)

**Summary:**  
Significant progress integrating the Material for MkDocs blog system within the Builder Hub site.  
Posts now render correctly with frontmatter metadata (title, date, category, tags), and individual post routes function as expected.  
However, the tag and category taxonomy pages remain unresolved despite multiple configuration iterations.

**Completed:**
- Material `blog` plugin installed and confirmed active.  
- Frontmatter parsing and slug generation verified.  
- Posts indexed under `/site/blog/posts/` and displayed on `/blog/`.  
- Archive and per-post routes confirmed operational.  
- `mkdocs-macros-plugin` installed and tested (ultimately incompatible for `blog` context rendering).  
- Full project successfully built and served locally without critical errors.

**Outstanding:**
- `/blog/categories/` and `/blog/tags/` return 404 or render as literal `{{ blog.* }}`.  
- `overrides/blog/` templates not yet detected (`INFO - Using custom templates` missing from build logs).  
- Suspected limitations in how `custom_dir` or context propagation works in Material v9.6.22.  
- Netlify redeploy pending following Phase 4 documentation updates.

**Next Steps (v0.4.3 Plan):**

1. Continue development of content cadence and tagging strategy once taxonomy routing confirmed.  
1. Deploy site updates to Netlify after phase documentation push.
1. Create minimal override test to confirm `custom_dir` resolution.  
1. Explore alternate taxonomy generation via `mkdocs-blog-plugin` if Material’s internal taxonomy remains nonfunctional. 

**Notes:**  
Phase 4 will remain open until taxonomy resolution and publishing cadence are validated.  
Current build stable; no regressions observed in other sections of the site.
